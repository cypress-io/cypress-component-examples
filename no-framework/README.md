## No Framework

This example shows how you can use Cypress component testing without a specific framework or adapter. Instead, we define a simple `mount` function that handles inserting a DOM element and any cleanup.

- "cypress open-ct": open interactive runner
- "cypress run-ct": run all tests headlessly
